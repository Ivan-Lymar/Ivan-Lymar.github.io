This book offers a conventional perspective on personal investing: spend less, invest more, use low-expense ratio index funds,
and avoid investment advisors. What stood out to me were the 4% rule and the breakdown of different portfolios' survivability,
as discussed in the Trinity Study.

The 4% rule suggests you can retire when 4% of your savings covers your annual expenses. This concept is a great starting point
for setting financial goals, such as determining your target savings number and annual contributions.

The Trinity Study, which is based on historical data, analyzes the survival rates of various asset allocations with annual
withdrawals of 3-12% over periods of 10, 20, and 30 years. The portfolios examined include stock/bond ratios of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75, and 0/100.
