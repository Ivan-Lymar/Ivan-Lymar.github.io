Through a tapestry of real-life stories from individuals across various life stages and circumstances,
the author illustrates profound ideas on how to navigate money matters. By blending practical wisdom with relatable anecdotes,
the book provides invaluable insights into the psychology behind our financial decisions,
making it a compelling read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of money and its impact on life.

If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Different people - different perception. Luck is very
important. Set some threshold that is enough for you. Compounding is cool. It's fine to fail in something, it happens to everyone.
Wealth is what you do not see. Do not show off by buying expensive things. Be prepared for unexpected events in your life,
literally anything can happen."
