A book that closes the gap between refactoring and design patterns.
It provides a practical approach to improving existing code by introducing design patterns through refactoring techniques.

What sets this book apart is its focus on practical application and unique style of explanation: explain what problem pattern solves,show pros and cons of each pattern, show code example, provide a step-by-step guide on how to change the code in a TDD manner.

Couple of ideas that I liked listed in this book:
1) postponing refactoring is like postponing paying on your credit card
2) it's not always possible to predict how code will evolve in the future and apply patterns immediately. Write that code in the simple way, refactor to patterns later.
3) applying a pattern should make code better, if it makes code harder to understand do not use patterns.
4) teams that are not familiar with patterns tend to push back on applying ones, even if it makes sense.

The book assumes a basic understanding of both refactoring and design patterns, making it more suitable for intermediate to advanced developers.
