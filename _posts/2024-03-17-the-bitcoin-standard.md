The book doesn't provide any in-depth explanation on how bitcoins works, it doesn't discuss
any investment strategies. In this thought-provoking exploration, the book challenges conventional notions of money,
highlighting its diverse forms throughout history, from rocks and metals to digital coins.
Critiquing the abandonment of the gold standard, it argues that the current system,
where the emission of dollars is unchecked by backing, is flawed. Proposing Bitcoin
as a potential alternative, the book suggests that its decentralized nature,
anonymity in transactions, and limited emission offer advantages over fiat currencies.
By advocating for Bitcoin as a modern-day gold standard, the book invites readers to reconsider their
understanding of money and its implications for financial systems and individual autonomy.

If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Anything can be used as money - rocks, metals, digital coins. 
Cancellation of the golden standard was a mistake and now USA controls emission of dollars that are not backed up by anything. Bitcoin can serve
as a new golden standard. It's not controlled by any government, transactions are anonymous and emission is limited, your bitcoins can't be
arrested."
