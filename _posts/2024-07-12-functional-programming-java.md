The book provides a thorough explanation of functional programming, supported by numerous examples.
I recommend it to senior developers, albeit with a cautious approach. While the book helped me grasp functional concepts better,
I wouldn’t fully adopt a functional style for my current project. Practically useful aspects include the result pattern,
null object pattern, optional, and streams. Thus, the book is excellent for broadening one's horizons,
but I wouldn’t consider it a practical coding guide. The effort required to shift the mindset and coding style
of an entire team does not justify the benefits offered by functional programming.
