The book scratches the surface of alternative investments like real estate, gold, oil and gas, angel investments.
Describes disadvantage of traditional investment strategies like stocks, bonds, crypto.
Good portion of the book is devoted to motivation stories and explanation on how to set goals.
It gives some basic info about taxes, inflation and how to use it to your advantage.

The book definitely expands the horizons on alternatives investments and to be more specific investment syndication.
However, I would not consider it as a fundamental investment guide on this topic. Based on the book and quick research on the internet,
minimal investment to start in this area is around 10-50k, which will not work for everyone. And it might be a bit too much money just to try it.

If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "If you want to be financially free, you must start investing. Wall Street
proposition is not stable and has a lot of disadvantages, so we have to use some non-traditional investments, e.g. real estate. Real estate itself is not ideal
because requires a lof of time to manage it, and here where investment syndication into multifamily building comes to a rescue. To successfully start
investing you need to be active, convince yourself, set up some observable goals and start going to meetups to build your network and get access
to private deals. And yeah, hire someone who will help you to reduce taxes."
