Dive into the world of financial freedom with this insightful book that goes beyond the conventional investment landscape.
Delving into alternative investments such as real estate, gold, oil, and gas, as well as angel investments, the narrative
unveils the drawbacks of traditional strategies involving stocks, bonds, and crypto. While offering motivational stories and
a comprehensive guide on goal-setting, the book also provides essential information on taxes, inflation, and strategic utilization
for financial advantage. A significant portion of the content focuses on the expansion of horizons through investment syndication,
particularly in multifamily buildings.

Although not positioned as a fundamental investment guide, the book sheds light on the evolving financial realm, emphasizing
that exploring alternative investments is crucial for a stable financial future. The narrative acknowledges that the initial
investment threshold, as discovered through both the book and additional research, may range from 10-50k, recognizing that this
might be impractical for everyone. However, the book serves as a valuable resource for those seeking to navigate the complexities
of non-traditional investments, offering practical advice on becoming an active investor, self-convincing, goal-setting, networking
through meetups, and engaging professionals to optimize tax strategies. In summary, this book provides a roadmap for those aspiring
to achieve financial independence by venturing into unconventional yet rewarding investment avenues.

If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "If you want to be financially free, you must start investing. Wall Street
proposition is not stable and has a lot of disadvantages, so we have to use some non-traditional investments, e.g. real estate. Real estate itself is not ideal
because requires a lof of time to manage it, and here where investment syndication into multifamily building comes to a rescue. To successfully start
investing you need to be active, convince yourself, set up some observable goals and start going to meetups to build your network and get access
to private deals. And yeah, hire someone who will help you to reduce taxes."
