Another great book from Mark J. Orr. Explains how social security is funded, calculated and taxed.
Explains consequences of taking your social security benefit before full retirement age and after,
spousal and survivor benefits, basics of medicare. Provides some strategies on how to maximize your
income from social security as a family and individual.

If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Figure out how your social security
is taxed and calculated to avoid surprises. Because of increasing life longevity try to take your social security
as late as you can, if you live long enough it will give you more money. There are some strategies you and your
spouse can apply to maximize your return as a family(62-70). Think about Long Time Care (LTC). There are ways to minimize
your taxes when you are retired. Social security is not guaranteed and there might be a situation where you will
have to found your retirement on your own, think about ways of doing it (IUL, IRA)".
