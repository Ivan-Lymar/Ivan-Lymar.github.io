If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Taxes take significant portion of our income,
and it's completely fine to try to reduce taxation (obviously legally). There are numerous ways how it can be achieved:
ROTH IRA, IUL, long term capital gain, "tricks" while renting/selling real estate. Do not hesitate to ask help from
CPAs, because it could save you a lot of money."
