If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Brain and eye are very powerful parts of human body. There are
some tricks that allow you to make it working faster while reading. Preview the text before reading, "Read" spaces between the words,
improve your peripheral vision, stop vocalizing while reading, do not double-check what you just read."
