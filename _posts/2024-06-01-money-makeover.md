Book contains a 7-step guide on how to become wealthy and free of any debt (a big portion of the book is devoted to explaining and showing examples of how ANY debt 
is harmful). Those steps are: save 1k$ for emergency, pay off all debts except mortgage, save 3-6 month of expenses, invest 15% of income in retirement, save 
for your kid's college, pay off your mortgage early, use wealth that you accumulated. 
As part of step 2 there is a concept of debt snowball. In short, it says that you need to ignore interest rates on your debts and start from paying off
the smallest one. Mathematically it's wrong, but it will give you a small win fast (by paying off smallest debt), which should empower you to continue following this
concept. It was interesting to me, because I've never thought about it from emotions/motivation standpoint.
One thing that is controversial is that the book insists on stopping use of credit cards at all. His argument is that miles that you get are most probably not used
and 20$ in cash back is not worth the risk of things going wrong and getting another debt with 20% interest rate.
