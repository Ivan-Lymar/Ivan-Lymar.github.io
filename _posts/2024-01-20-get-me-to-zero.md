If I were to put this book in one paragraph, it would be something like - "Plan your retirement. Because of the trillions
of national debt current tax rate and social security is not guaranteed. Compared to historical data, current tax rate is low.
Take advantage of paying taxes right now by using roth IRA. IUL is super cool - you can't lose your money, all profit from IUL
is tax-free, you can take loans from it. By taking advantage of tax-free income from ROTH and IUL 
you also make your social security benefit tax-free."
